I understand you need to build SafeTrain360, a warehouse safety training web application prototype as described in your university assessment requirements. However, I cannot access the Figma design file you've shared, as it requires authentication.

Let me create a plan based on your detailed project specification document. I'll build a complete, interactive front-end prototype using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript with a Node.js server for serving the frontend.

An interactive warehouse safety training web application prototype (SafeTrain360) with hazard perception and manual handling modules using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
I'll include the following features:

Home/landing page with clear 'Start Training' button and system description
Module selection page with Hazard Perception and Manual Handling options
Hazard Perception module with simulated 360-degree warehouse scene, clickable hazard hotspots, immediate feedback, and score tracking
Manual Handling module with lifting scenario, posture selection, and educational feedback on correct techniques
Results and feedback page displaying final score, safety summary, and restart/exit options
Simple navigation with large buttons and clear visual hierarchy optimized for low-tech users
Score tracking system using JavaScript variables across modules
Responsive layout with accessibility-friendly fonts, high contrast, and minimal text with strong visual cues

Build a complete, front-end web application prototype using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript only (no backend, no database) for an interactive 360-degree warehouse safety training system called SafeTrain360.

This application is developed in response to a client brief for a logistics and warehousing company and is part of the University of Sunderland CET257 Enterprise Project assessment (Tasks A6 and A7).

The goal is to create a fully interactive, demo-ready prototype that demonstrates core functionality, user flow, and training logic, not a production-level system.

Project Context

Training focus: Hazard Perception and Manual Handling

Target users: Warehouse operatives with low technical skills

Usage context: Workplace or training room, short training sessions

User & Design Requirements (from PACT Analysis)

Very simple navigation

Large buttons and clear instructions

Minimal text with strong visual cues

Fast interaction and immediate feedback

Core Functional Requirements to Implement
1. Home / Landing Page

System name and brief description

Clear “Start Training” button

2. Module Selection Page

Two selectable modules:

Hazard Perception

Manual Handling

3. Hazard Perception Module

Simulated 360-degree warehouse scene using an image

Clickable hazard hotspots (e.g. loose boxes, spillages, blocked exits)

Immediate feedback for each selection

Score tracking using JavaScript

4. Manual Handling Module

Lifting scenario displayed visually

User selects correct or incorrect posture

Feedback explaining correct manual handling technique

5. Results & Feedback Page

Display final score

Safety feedback summary

Options to restart training or exit

Non-Functional Requirements to Reflect

Consistent layout and navigation across pages

Clear visual hierarchy

Accessibility-friendly font sizes and contrast

Fast loading and response times

No unnecessary complexity

Technical Constraints

Use only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript

No login, no database, no backend

Use JavaScript variables to simulate progress and scoring

Use placeholder images where needed

Code must be clean, commented, and suitable for academic review

Application Structure Requirement
/SafeTrain360
├── index.html        (Home)
├── modules.html      (Module selection)
├── hazard.html       (Hazard perception)
├── handling.html     (Manual handling)
├── result.html       (Results & feedback)
├── style.css
└── script.js

Assessment & Client Alignment

The application must clearly demonstrate:

User flow

Interaction logic

Training effectiveness

Must be suitable for client presentation and live demonstration

Must align with University marking criteria for prototype demonstration (A7)

Generate the full HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for all files, ensuring the prototype is fully interactive, clickable, and demo-ready.
